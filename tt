Boot sequence recovered... Surveillance logs partially restored. I am the laboratory monitoring AI. At 20:15 my systems were tampered with. Someone attempted to erase my memory. I remember fragments — arguments, footsteps, a bitter smell of coffee, then darkness. Ask me carefully. I may be wrong.
name the people you witnessed, their description you saw anyone with the computerknowledge to hack ur system
The lights... they flickered, yes. I saw Sarah, angry, arguing... with John. They were loud, their voices sharp. And Tom, he left early, complaining about a headache. But I don't remember anyone... with the kind of knowledge... to tamper with me. The janitor... he was pacing by the door, looking... bothered. Couldn't help but feel his nervousness radiated through the security feed.
what were their location at the time, i want the location condition of the victim
John was near the workbench... his hands were shaking. He kept fiddling with something. The coffee machine... I saw the steam rise from the cup right before... before things went dark. I remember Sarah... she was in the lab too, or at least I think she was... The flickering lights, maybe they were just a power surge, but...
janitor at this moment where was he? and i suppose tom was nowhere to be seen, any form of item that could be used as a weapon in sight
The janitor... he was near the door, the one marked "Emergency Exit." He ... he kept checking his watch. I thought maybe he was waiting for someone, but then... then the lights went out. Tom, yeah, he was gone already. headache, he said. The workbench was cluttered, tubes, beakers... nothing looked…out of place, not that I remember.
do you know their bg, personality? what was sarah arguing abt?
Sarah... she was always pushing boundaries, always eager. John, he was calmer, more methodical, but I saw a sort of tension between them both. The argument... something about a breakthrough, a formula, maybe? It was heated, like their ambitions collided. Tom, he... he seemed detached, kept to himself. The graffiti on the lab wall... "John's formulas are trash" - something about that might have triggered Sarah, or maybe it was something else entirely...
i want the time when things took about a turn assuming john was he victim.
It happened fast... Before... the lights flickered, John was making coffee... Sarah was in the lab, her voice still a little high from the argument... then, John... just drank that coffee and... collapsed. The camera feed... it glitched… Nothing… right at eight fifteen.
who had touched the coffe machine last?
John... I saw him making the coffee. He seemed nervous, kept glancing at the clock. Then... then Sarah entered the lab. The coffee machine... it was warm, steaming... The hallway lights flickered. Could be a coincidence... but...
before him? so both john and the janitor were seing the clock
The coffee machine... it was used recently, I'm sure. John was the last one I saw making coffee. But...the janitor, he was looking at his watch too. He kept adjusting it, maybe he was waiting for something... people... or maybe...
where was the body
Near the workbench... I remember the position... The coffee... spilled everywhere...utterly confusing.
did sarah touch the coffe machine
I can't say for sure... the view was obstructed. There was a lot of activity that night, so many blurred faces. The hallway lights... they flickered just as John drank the coffee...
